# Playlist

Playlists define how content is to be played on any player assigned to the playlist. The onQ CMS has two playlist systems: **legacy playlists** (standard CMS playlists) and **campaign sub-playlists** (campaign divisions). The Playlist Registry assigns each playlist a globally unique ID so that both types can be referenced through a single API.

- [Fetch Playlist](#fetch-playlist)
- [Bulk Playlist](#create-a-bulk-playlist)

## Create a Bulk Playlist

### Endpoint: playlist_bulk/create

The bulk playlist request creates a special type of playlist that is unique to each assigned player. This playlist can be viewed, edited and deleted, but not reassigned via the CMS. If the bulk playlist request is called on a player that already has an API playlist assigned, the playlist is deleted and recreated with the settings as per the new request.

### Request Parameters
The CMS expects an array of playlist objects as the input.

| playlist_width | integer	|	True | Playlist Width |
| playlist_height | integer	|	True | Playlist Height |
| playlist  | array (playlist asset object) | True     | A list of assets to playback. See below table for parameters. Assets will play back in the order that they are in the array, restarting playback from the start once the end of the playlist is reached.

### Playlist Asset JSON Object

| tags      | object (see table below) | False      | Tags to control which players play back this asset.
| validity  | object (see table below) | False      | An object that defines whether an asset is valid to play within this playlist. See table below for values. |

### File JSON Object

| Parameter  | Type                     | Required | Description |

Asset will be stored at the root level if not present.
| references | array (string)           | False    | A list of additional names that refer to this asset. Used to provide an additional name/tag against the asset in the proof of play reports.
